# Welcome to Mini-project-3 

<h3>This Notes App is a mini-project. The purpose to make this is for practicing & understanding more about Typescript & Bootstrap.
</h3>
<h4>This is small project so I didn't save the notes to local-storage, so if you refresh page, notes will be set to default again.</h4>
